Built on the Solana blockchain, it combines modern financial tools with a commitment to cultural restoration, creating a thriving ecosystem for professionals, entrepreneurs, and underserved communities.

1. iTekLux Coin: A token designed for equity and innovation in transportation, logistics, and communication industries.
2. iTekBox: A financial ecosystem offering credit-building tools, tax integrations, and membership management for IEEE, AAAS, and BFH events.
3. LuxTeknomics: A unique economic model that allocates resources for cultural restoration, community development, and financial empowerment.

Technology Overview
